Title: Ubuntu is WHAT?
Author: Minh Tran
Body: Today was a roller coaster of emotions. I was having a good time setting up nav bars and getting use to PUGJS.
Oh my god, I can't even begin to tell you how frustrated I was with PUG. Good name, but writing code is such a pain with it.
I ended up switching back to what I'm familiar with, EJS. A friend of mine told me to look into VUEJS, angular, and react.
For now, EJS will have to do. "MVP" (Minimal viable product), he called it. After switching or to EJS, the css part was actually
quite fun. I ended up getting stuck with the mobile responsive views. It's working, but not to my liking. I'm going to come
back to it later this week.

Now, on to the deploying part. Domain name? Easy. Hosting service sign up? Easy. Using the command lines for Ubuntu? Sweet.
Everything was going perfect. Installed all dependencies without problems? YES! And then...
ERROR: "Failed to look up view". After about an hour of researching on stackoverflow... It turns out that Ubuntu is CASE SENSITIVE!!
My dumbass named my directory as Views instead of views (apparently MacOS does't care about case sensitivity). For those newbies like me
out there. camelCase! Anyway, if you are reading this now, that means I have already added more blogging features. (:
I could probably write more but my brain is fried from coding all day...GOOD NIGHT. Oh, did I already tell you that Ubuntu is
CASE SENSITIVE??!?!? /sigh...
